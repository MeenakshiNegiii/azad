<h1>Policy</h1>

<p>Think of a policy as “the big picture,” serving as a guideline and setting the direction for your company. It conveys your company’s culture, values, and philosophy. It sets expectations for both internal audiences (employees) and external audiences (customers and community).</p>

<p>A procedure, on the other hand, describes the specific steps to take to go in the direction the policy sets forth. It might include a checklist of actions to take or a step-by-step process to follow, including approval that might be needed or reporting instructions.
In short, these are the key things I believe every small business owner must have in place in order to have a successful 2017.</p>
<h3>If we are talking about Business plan so Every business needs a business plan as well as policy..</h3><ol class="c">
<li>Clear customer value proposition</li> 
<li>Competitor analysis</li>
<li>Positive cash flow</li>
<li>Strong marketing plan</li>
</ol>
<p id="p1">It’s similar to the difference between a goal and a task, with the goal outlining the end result you’re aiming for and the task defining the specific action you need to take to meet that goal.</p>
